* Config
This folder is meant to be cloned into the ~/.emacs.d/ folder in order
to have the same configuration file. 

- init.el is the main file for emacs configuration. Makes emacs work.
- config.org is an organized file containing all elisp code. Makes emacs
  behave similar.
- custom.el is the file with settings set by Custom
  programatically. Makes emacs look similar.
